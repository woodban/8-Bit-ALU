# 8-Bit ALU (Adder/Subtractor)

## Abstract  
This project presents the design and implementation of an **8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using **74LS283 4-bit binary adders** and **74LS86 XOR gates**. The ALU performs **addition and subtraction** on two 8-bit binary numbers, selected through DIP switches, and displays results via LEDs. Subtraction is implemented using the **two’s complement method**, where the B input is inverted through XOR gates and a carry-in is introduced.  

This project demonstrates fundamental principles of digital arithmetic, binary operations, and hardware design using TTL logic ICs. The design was developed in **KiCad**, and the schematic captures both theoretical and practical insights into ALU construction.

## Features
- **8-bit Addition**: Direct binary addition of inputs A and B.  
- **8-bit Subtraction**: Implemented using two’s complement arithmetic.  
- **Operation Control**: Single select line to toggle between addition and subtraction.  
- **Inputs**: DIP switches for A and B values.  
- **Outputs**: LEDs displaying result bits.

## Components Used
- **74LS283** – Two 4-bit full adders (to build 8-bit adder/subtractor).  
- **74LS86** – XOR gates (to invert B input during subtraction).  
- **DIP Switches** – User inputs for binary values.  
- **LEDs** – Result output display.

## Circuit Overview
- **Addition Mode**: `Result = A + B`  
- **Subtraction Mode**: `Result = A + (~B) + 1`
